% this is the case of a better performanc access pattern, 
% app1 works like zipfian, which has the memory num_memaccess = num_cl;
% and app2 works like "round robin", which has num_memaccess = num_cl + 1;

global num_memaccess num_cl;
prob11 = [0.7 0.2]; prob2 = ones(1, num_cl * 0.5 - 2); 
prob12 = prob2 * (0.1 / (num_cl * 0.5 - 2));
prob1 = [prob11 prob12];

prob2 = ones(1, num_cl * 0.5 + 1);
prob2 = prob2 * (1 / (num_cl * 0.5 + 1));
alphabet1 = (1 : 2 : num_memaccess);
alphabet2 = (2 : 2 : num_memaccess);
Y(1) = randsrc(1, 1, [alphabet1; prob1]);
Y(2) = randsrc(1, 1, [alphabet2; prob]);
% Q: App1 is always accessing odd cacheline, App2 is always accessing even
